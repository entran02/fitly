To Do:

implement remove pieces from my pieces
    ( when we remove piece from my piece, remove it from outfit as well)
    delete from my pieces
    - query using user.user_id and piece_id
    - - if piece.user_id is user.user_id, delete piece
    - - else remove from wishlisted_pieces


create outfits (same logic as creating pieces)
    add pieces to outfits from home / my pieces
    remove from outfits
    edit outfit information like name 

use brand and style in the piece uploading and include it in the search filter

update user information in account page (maybe optional)


- implement secure password hashing (optional) make sure that when user is returned by the backend, that the password is ommitted from the fields
