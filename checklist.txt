- implement secure password hashing (optional) make sure that when user is returned by the backend, that the password is ommitted from the fields

create outfits (same logic as creating pieces)
add pieces to outfits from home / my pieces
remove pieces from my pieces
( when we remove piece from my piece, remove it from outfit?)


add piece to my pieces (insert into fitly.wishlisted_pieces)
- query using user.user_id and piece_id, if entry exists, then don't insert
- else insert
button can make call to api multiple times but backend will handle not allowing a query

delete from my pieces
- query using user.user_id and piece_id
- - if piece.user_id is user.user_id, delete piece
- - else remove from wishlisted_pieces


update user information in account page
